## NaijaStream Subscription Data Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **NaijaStream’s subscription dataset** of 2,000 records to uncover insights into **revenue, churn, retention, regional distribution, and device usage**. Using Excel, the data was cleaned, normalized for monthly and annual plans, and transformed into a dashboard with pivot tables, KPIs, and visualizations.  

##  Business Objectives  
The primary goals were to measure **recurring revenue (MRR & ARR)**, calculate **average revenue per user (ARPU)**, identify revenue-driving tiers and regions, and evaluate **churn behavior**. These insights guided recommendations to boost revenue, improve retention, and optimize customer experience.  

##  Key Findings  
- **Revenue**  
  - Total revenue: ₦12,099,800  
  - MRR: ₦1,007,450 | ARR: ₦12,089,400  
  - ARPU: ₦503.73 monthly | ₦6,044.80 annual  

- **Churn & Retention**  
  - Overall churn: ~49%  
  - Premium tier yields highest ARPU but faces retention risks  

- **Regional Insights**  
  - Top revenue regions: West, North, and East Nigeria (₦4.34M combined)  
  - Lagos, Enugu, and Kano lead in state-level performance  

- **Device Usage**  
  - Mobile dominates with ~47.8% of streams, highlighting need for mobile-first strategies  

##  Recommendations  
1. **Regional Growth** – Expand marketing in high-performing regions and states.  
2. **Reduce Churn** – Introduce loyalty perks, targeted win-back campaigns, and stronger onboarding for Premium and monthly users.  
3. **Upselling** – Convert Basic tier subscribers with bundles, family plans, and incentives.  
4. **Mobile Optimization** – Improve mobile UI/UX, offline streaming, and data-saving features.  

##  Conclusion  
The NaijaStream analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging subscription data for strategic growth. Despite strong revenue generation, the high churn rate underscores the need for proactive retention measures. By focusing on **regional expansion, tier upgrades, and mobile experience**, NaijaStream can unlock higher customer lifetime value, reduce churn, and sustain long-term revenue growth in Nigeria’s competitive streaming market.
